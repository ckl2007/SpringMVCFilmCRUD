##Spring MVC Film CRUD
### Week 8 Team Homework at Skill Distillery 

###Overview

Spring MVC Film CRUD builds on the previous week's Film Query application. Film Query ran in the console and Spring MVC Film CRUD runs in the browser. The user has three entry points into the program from index.html: search by keyword, search by film id, and adding a film to the database. Searching by keyword returns a list of films and gives the user the option of editing a film's data, deleting the film the database, or viewing the film's full details. Searching for a film by ID allows the user the same options for the single result returned. If a query, update, add, or delete fails or returns a null result, the user is notified with an appropriate message.
